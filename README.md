## Project Outline

The goal of this project was for me to look in to React and, secondly, to brush up on my SQL query writing.

Familiarizing myself with React I tried to focus on looking for the best ways the tools could be used while also learning the best practices in file structure.

In terms of data structure, I settled on using SQLite. Keeping the data stored on my local machine allowed me to later use this app for my own purposes (hence storing the tasks) and, at the same time, brushing up on query rules which I havenâ€™t wrote in a long time.
